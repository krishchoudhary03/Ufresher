# Quick Fix for Vercel 404 Error

## The Issue
Your Vercel deployment is showing a 404 error because React Router needs special configuration to handle client-side routing on Vercel.

## Files Added/Fixed

### 1. `vercel.json` - Vercel Configuration
This file tells Vercel to redirect all routes to `index.html` so React Router can handle them.

### 2. `public/_redirects` - Alternative Redirect File
Backup redirect configuration for Vercel.

### 3. Updated `vite.config.ts`
Added proper build configuration for Vercel deployment.

### 4. Updated `index.html`
Fixed the title and meta tags for the U-Fresher app.

### 5. Updated `src/pages/Home.tsx`
Fixed the component to work with React Router navigation.

### 6. Created `src/pages/NotFound.tsx`
Added a proper 404 page component.

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push these changes to your repository:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel 404 error - add routing configuration"
   git push
   ```

2. **Vercel will automatically redeploy** with the new configuration.

3. **If it still doesn't work:**
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Go to your project settings
   - Under "Build & Development Settings":
     - Build Command: `npm run build`
     - Output Directory: `dist`
     - Install Command: `npm install`

4. **Redeploy manually** from the Vercel dashboard.

## What These Changes Do

- **`vercel.json`**: Tells Vercel to serve `index.html` for all routes, allowing React Router to handle client-side routing
- **Updated components**: Fixed navigation to work with React Router instead of state-based routing
- **Build configuration**: Optimized the build process for Vercel deployment

The 404 error should be resolved after these changes are deployed! ðŸš€
